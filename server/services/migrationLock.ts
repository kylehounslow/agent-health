/**
 * Migration Lock Service
 *
 * In-memory migration lock for preventing concurrent index operations.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This lock is process-local and only protects against concurrent
 * operations within a single Node.js process. It does NOT provide distributed
 * locking. If multiple server instances are running against the same OpenSearch
 * cluster, they could perform conflicting migrations simultaneously.
 *
 * This is acceptable because Agent Health is designed as a single-process
 * application (see CLAUDE.md architecture). If multi-instance support is
 * needed in the future, replace this with a distributed lock (e.g., OpenSearch
 * document-based locking or an external coordination service).
 *
 * Per-index write lock that prevents concurrent writes while an index is being
 * reindexed to fix incompatible mappings. During reindex the original index is
 * deleted and recreated — concurrent writes would either fail with 404 or
 * auto-create the index with wrong mappings again.
 *
 * The lock is per-index: if only `evals_runs` needs reindex, writes to
 * `evals_test_cases` still work.
